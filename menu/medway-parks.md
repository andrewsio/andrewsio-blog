title: Medway Parks
---

In January 2022 we made it our goal to visit each of the 116 parks and open spaces listed in the Medway Council website. The aim of the **Medway Parks Challenge** is to see more of Medway, to get ourselves out, do some walking and appreciate the green spaces around us. You can read more about the rules of the challenge in [this blog post](https://andrews.io/blog/medway-2022-parks-challenge).

Below is a list of the parks shown on the [Medway Council website](https://www.medway.gov.uk/directory/22/find_a_park_play_or_game_area) as of January 1st, 2022. There is a link to the Council page for each park in the list below. When we've visited the park, I'll mark with a tick '‚úÖ' and include the date and a link to the blog post. Since there are more parks in Medway than those listed on the Council page, I'll share those too, but mark them with a 'üåº' emoji. Visiting non-listed parks doesn't count towards our goal of visiting all listed Medway Parks. [Eight of Medway's parks were awarded Green Flag status](https://www.medway.gov.uk/news/article/1025/eight_of_medway_s_parks_amongst_the_best_in_the_uk) in 2021, these are marked with a '‚≠êÔ∏è' emoji.
