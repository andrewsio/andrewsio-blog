Hey! I'm Laurence Andrews 👋 I am many things, but mostly I am a technology guy, scuba diver and wannabe sailor. I live in the English riverside village of [Upnor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Upnor) with my wife, Victoria and miniature dachshund, Dexter 🐶.

This is my blog, where I post about all sort of things, from [why I can't eat oysters](https://andrews.io/blog/so-long-oysters.html) to why [I took a train to Turkey](https://andrews.io/blog/train-to-turkey-intro.html) and lots things in between. I also have a [micro.blog](https://andrewsio.micro.blog/), where I post fewer words more often. I don't really do the socials, because I think they're [bad for us](https://ledger.humanetech.com/), but you can find me on  [twitter](https://twitter.com/14zz4) if that's your thing.

When I'm not updating my blog, I work as a Solution Architect for the Canada-based, commercial real estate services company, [Colliers International](https://www.colliers.com) where I help turn ideas into projects and generally get things done. I have certificates in [TOGAF 9](https://andrews.io/blog/togaf9.html), Prince 2 and ITIL, among other things. My background is in networking and I have had the opportunity to lead and run projects for companies such as Cushman & Wakefield, The Ministry of Justice, The Department for Culture, Media and Sport, Medway Council and _(very briefly in 2012)_ even The Olympic Delivery Agency. I have spoken and presented at industry events, including most recently at [WAN Summit London](https://blog.telegeography.com/global-real-estate-services-business-builds-for-the-future-with-sd-wan) where in 2017 where I gave a presentation on SD-WAN _(which was very trendy at the time)_.

Outside of work I have lots of different passions, if you have a poke around on the blog you'll get an idea of what I'm in too. Here's a quick list to get you started:
