title: üëã Hey! I'm Laurence
---

I am a technology guy, blogger, scuba diver and wannabe sailor. I live in the English riverside village of [Upnor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Upnor) with my wife, Victoria and miniature dachshund, Dexter üê∂. This is my blog, where I post about all sort of things, from [why I can't eat oysters](https://andrews.io/blog/so-long-oysters.html) to why [I took a train to Turkey](https://andrews.io/blog/train-to-turkey-intro.html) and lots things in between. I also have a [micro.blog](https://andrewsio.micro.blog/), where I post fewer words more often. I don't really do the socials, because I think they're [bad for us](https://ledger.humanetech.com/), but you can find me on [<i class="fab fa-twitter"></i>twitter](https://twitter.com/14zz4) if that's your thing.

When I'm not updating my blog, I work as a Solution Architect for the Canada-based, commercial real estate services company, [Colliers International](https://www.colliers.com) where I help turn ideas into projects and generally get things done. I have certificates in [TOGAF 9](https://andrews.io/blog/togaf9.html), Prince 2 and ITIL, among other things. My background is in networking and I have had the opportunity to lead and run projects for companies such as [Cushman & Wakefield](https://www.cushwake.com/), [The Ministry of Justice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ministry_of_Justice_(United_Kingdom)), [The Department for Culture, Media and Sport](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Department_for_Digital,_Culture,_Media_and_Sport), [Medway Council](https://www.medway.gov.uk/) and _(very briefly in 2012)_ even [The Olympic Delivery Authority](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/olympic-delivery-authority). I have spoken and presented at industry events, including most recently at [WAN Summit London](https://blog.telegeography.com/global-real-estate-services-business-builds-for-the-future-with-sd-wan) where I gave a presentation on SD-WAN _(which was very trendy at the time)_.

Outside of work I have lots of different passions and interests, if you have a poke around on the blog you'll get an idea of what I'm in too. Here's a quick list to get you started:
- ‚úàÔ∏è**Travel**, here's list of all the [countries I've visited](https://andrews.io/menu/countries.html)
- ü§ø**Scuba Diving**, I'm a PADI Tec45 and like it [deep, dark and scary](https://andrews.io/blog/padi-tec45.html)
- üöÇ**Trains**, here's my [UK Rail Map](https://andrews.io/menu/railmap.html) and some [other blog posts](https://andrews.io/tag/trains)
- ‚õµÔ∏è**Sailing**, In lockdown I did my RYA [Day Skipper](https://andrews.io/tag/dayskipper) Theory
- üìù**Writing Lists**, my [Bucket List](https://andrews.io/menu/thelist.html) is a long-term feature of the blog
