Here I am in Moscow's [Red Square](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Square) in front of [St Basil's Cathedral](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint_Basil's_Cathedral). The square was surprisingly empty but it was very cold! I managed to visit again in the day time and it was much busier. Moscow was definitely the most interesting place I've been so far, I look forward to going back with the confidence that I survived my first trip!
