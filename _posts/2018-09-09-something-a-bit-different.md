Keeping with this year's theme, [The Year of Smart](/blog/2018-the-year-of-smart), I participated in my first non-technical training programme. The course was run by the [Centre for Creative Leadership](https://www.ccl.org/), a US-based non-profit organisation who focus on leadership development. CCL run the [Maximising Your Leadership Potential](https://www.ccl.org/open-enrollment-programs/maximizing-your-leadership_potential/) course only three times a year at their Europe HQ in Brussels, so after booking in March I had to wait a while before attending.

The wait was absolutely worthwhile, while I was a little apprehensive I really enjoyed the course, met a lot of interesting people and learnt more about myself than I could ever have possibly imagined. The programme is very well structured and split into three components:

1. Pre-work, this includes employee 360s, surveys, questionnaires and feedback. This information is used to build a picture of the attendee's personality, role, approach, etc.
2. Course, this included 2.5 classroom days spent reviewing the pre-work results, as well as many breakaway sessions, social events and even a personal 1:1 coaching session
3. Follow-up, this will consist of applying the tools and techniques learned and a 6-week post-course coaching session to review progress.

While there wasn't much time for sightseeing I managed to spend some time walking around the European Quarter with one of the other course attendees, Steve. I had visited Brussels before but I don't remember much more than the Grand Place so was eager to see more, the European quarter is an interesting place, with many buildings signposted as to their purpose, many I recognise from News/TV. As a remain voter, it was striking just how large the EU organisation is and brought home the reality of what how different things could be if the UK opts for a 'Hard Brexit'.

We also walked around the beautiful Cinquantenaire park and stumbled across [The European Sport Climbing Youth Championships](http://www.ifsc-climbing.org/index.php/component/ifsc/?view=event&WetId=7209#!type=nat_team_ranking&comp=7209&cat=79,80,81,82,83,84) and a lovely little pop-up bar. The combination allowed for a nice relaxed beer while watching children fall from a climbing wall, very entertaining!
