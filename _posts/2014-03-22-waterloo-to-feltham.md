Last week I got to go and visit Cisco at their office in Bedfont Lakes near Heathrow. We're thinking about moving to Cisco telephony and wanted to go and check out some of the newer handsets and discuss pricing etc. Of course, I knew that this meant I get to go somewhere new on the train! I caught the 11:50 Waterloo to Reading service to Feltham.

The train was a class 458, number 013. If you look carefully at the picture you can still see the remains of the 'mo-vember' mustache which was added to raise awareness for men's health issues.

The meeting with Cisco went well, Cisco voice is hopefully just around the corner. I've scheduled CCNA Voice training in preparation, expect many, many boring posts next week.
