What to do when in Bangor, Wales? Go and see Holyhead Lifeboat of course!

The boat was spotlessly clean and very prominent in the small marina. To get to the marina involved a 10 minute walk from the train station, which was pretty cold for February. We weren't able to get up close as the boat is moored on a private pontoon but luckily it was within picture distance. The vessel is named Christopher Pearce and was launched new in 2003 to replace the previous Arun Class named "Kenneth Thelwall".
