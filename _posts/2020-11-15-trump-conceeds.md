There's no doubt that we're living in a time where history is being written. Since the results of the 2020 US Presidential election were announced Trump has insisted that he is the rightful winner, despite, err... Democracy.

After days of victory claiming and tweeting nonsense he slipped up with this gem:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">He only won in the eyes of the FAKE NEWS MEDIA. I concede NOTHING! We have a long way to go. This was a RIGGED ELECTION!</p>&mdash; Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) <a href="https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1327979630477922304?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 15, 2020</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

Before later reassuring his following that didn't concede:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">He only won in the eyes of the FAKE NEWS MEDIA. I concede NOTHING! We have a long way to go. This was a RIGGED ELECTION!</p>&mdash; Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) <a href="https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1327979630477922304?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 15, 2020</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

This saga is as entertaining and frightening as I hoped it would be. I absolutely love that Twitter have added the dispute tags to his tweets. Can't wait to see what happens next, I hope they make a Netflix documentary out of it.
