Writing this somewhat unusual post because I have some random pieces of information that I don't want to lose to time.

Lewis Richard Andrews, born (aprx) 1892 is my Great-Granduncle, that is, my Grandfather's Father's Brother. He was born in Battersea, London and led a rather interesting life, as a solider in WW1, later moving to Shanghai, China where he worked as a bouillon dealer, met his wife, Hope Wilson Nelson, they were interned by the Japanese in WW2, ultimately moving to a place called Tulip Hill, Maryland.

Over the years I've tried to piece things together about his life, but have never really manage to get a full picture. Here's a collection of obscure links.

Goes without saying, if you have any more information on Lewis, please do get in touch with me via Twitter or email. 


## Historic Records

There is an oral transcript and tapes held by Columbia University catalog item is [accessible here](https://clio.columbia.edu/locations/show/Rare+Book). Seems that an interviewer called Frederick Peterson Jessup recorded Lewis in 1980, where he shared information about his life. The records are accessible, but only in-person at the library in NYC.

Most interestingly of all, there is a [collection of four boxes of papers, photographs, diaries, plays, etc held at Harvard Univesity](https://guides.library.harvard.edu/ld.php?content_id=12548285). Which is noted as a gift from a Johnathan Cannon in 2010. Link to the catalog item here. It references the Columbia oral transcript. This is held at the Harvard-Yenching Library in Boston, MA, [link to the archives here](https://guides.library.harvard.edu/harvardyenchingarchives).
- I'll note here that I'm so, so incredibly frustrated to have not known about this before the few trips I made in the past to Boston. Next time I'm in the US, I'm going out of my way to look at this.

## The Tulip Hill House

From 1946 onwards Lewis and Hope lived in an absolutely stunning house called Tulip Hill. It was built between 1755 and 1756. The house has it's [own wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tulip_Hill). The house is on the US register for historic building, but is still privately owned and sold in 2011 for somewhere in the region of 2.5 Million dollars. My grandfather, Richard Andrews met Lewis in the US in his later years and was shown the house.

There is a fantastic amount of detail provided about Tulip Hill in the September [1952 edition of the Maryland Historical Magazine](https://msa.maryland.gov/megafile/msa/speccol/sc5800/sc5881/000001/000000/000187/pdf/msa_sc_5881_1_187.pdf). It features a description of the construction and ownership though the years. Page 208 mentions Lewis and Hope as the owners of Tulip Hill from 1946

Another interesting [link here to the US National Register of Historic Places for Tulip Hill](https://msa.maryland.gov/megafile/msa/stagsere/se1/se5/001000/001200/001251/pdf/msa_se5_1251.pdf). It mentions Lewis and Hope as the present owners. There is also a separate 'tenant house' on the estate which [has it's own records](https://msa.maryland.gov/megafile/msa/stagsere/se1/se5/002000/002000/002062/pdf/msa_se5_2062.pdf), again mentioning Lewis.

## Misc

Randomly, [some bowls, dishes etc, sold by Sotherby's](https://www.sothebys.com/en/auctions/ecatalogue/2013/chinese-works-of-art-n08974/lot.189.html) in 2013 which are noted as from the collection of Lewis and Hope Andrews at Tulip Hill. I've seen other auctions for similar things from time to time, but can't find the links any more.

While in Maryland, both Hope and Lewis seemed to some some affiliation with [Goucher College](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goucher_College). They are both briefly mentioned in a publication of the college's history, [accessible here](https://archive.org/details/historyofgoucher00knip).

While living in Shanghai, [this link seems to suggest](https://voicemap.me/tour/shanghai/gangsters-secret-gardens-and-art-deco-lane-houses-the-hidden-history-of-the-french-concession/sites/former-italian-consulate) that they lived in a villa which was sold in 1936 to serve as the Italian Consulate. I did find another document to support this theory.
