Like an increasing number of people in the social media age, I spend far too much of my time consuming online content. It's an addiction; an addiction to likes, swipes and retweets - it's a waste of precious time and attention. The designers and engineers who built these systems talk openly about how concerned they are about the habits that people are forming ([here's a great article on the topic](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/oct/05/smartphone-addiction-silicon-valley-dystopia)). I think the concept of the 'Attention Economy' is really interesting and I'm glad it's increasingly becoming accepted as a societal issue in the digital age. So important is this issue that [Apple have included controls](https://www.apple.com/uk/newsroom/2018/06/ios-12-introduces-new-features-to-reduce-interruptions-and-manage-screen-time/) in software to give insight and restrict how much time is being spent on our devices - that in itself shows just how important of an issue this is.

I'm going to begin to stamp it out. Inspired by my [Year of Smart](https://www.andrews.io/blog/2018-the-year-of-smart) and CGP Grey's similar 'Project Cyclops' approach on the [Hello Internet Podcast](http://www.hellointernet.fm/podcast/109) I am going to better invest my attention. I don't want to be a crazy person and cut everything out, but I do need some ground rules... The below will take effect immediately, cold-turkey style.

To avoid any confusion: Stop will mean I remove the application and don't access the site at all, my accounts will still exist. Control will mean I increase awareness for my use of the service, perhaps implementing restrictions around the number of times I check per day or only using in certain situations. Continue is self-explanatory, I hope to improve the amount of time I spend reading and writing blog posts as that's a positive use of time (typically!).

## Stop

- Instagram
- Reddit
- Untappd
- Facebook
- YouTube

## Control

- Twitter
- Personal Email
- News Websites
- Netflix
- Spotify

## Continue

- Messaging (SMS, iMessage, WhatsApp, Facebook Messenger)
- Podcasts
- Reading
- Blogging

**Wish me luck!**
