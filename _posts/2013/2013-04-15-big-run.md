Google Tracks is awesome, this is my first recorded run this year. The weather this weekend has been pretty warm and in total contrast to last week I was getting too warm. You can see in the center image that I walked a fair amount not because I was out of breath, just because I needed to cool down! I'm fairly confident that I'll be able to improve my time over the same distance fairly easily, but hey it's a good baseline!

The only other annoyance is that my Nexus 4 is pretty chunky and it moves around a lot in my pocket. Perhaps I should buy a phone/arm holder...
