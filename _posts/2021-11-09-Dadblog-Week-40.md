Well, we had hoped that by now baby would be with us! Seems it‚Äôs not time just yet‚Ä¶. Baby is still doing very well though, getting itself ready for the big day which is getting closer every minute that passes. Victoria is doing fine too and is coping very well, despite baby being really quite big!

Weekend before last we went and did another ultrasound at the hospital, just to check that everything was progressing fine and also did some sessions on the monitor to check heart rate and movement. All very good, baby was very active and kept kicking the monitor! Doing these on a weekend is a much more pleasant experience. We had thought that the monitor and scan were showing signs that things were starting, but seems not.

All being well, baby should arrive with us anytime now, we‚Äôre both very ready and excited. As are all of our family and friends! Victoria of course continues to be on maternity leave and I am waiting for the day that I can join her on paternity leave. Work have been very accommodating with everything but not knowing when I‚Äôll be off and when I‚Äôll be back is making things a little tricky. Lots going on and working on building some momentum for some exciting identity access management and enterprise application integration projects in 2022.

In home news, there‚Äôs been quite a lot going on‚Ä¶ The house is move is progressing well, our solicitor has been busy managing the sale and purchase and so far everyone is playing ball. We have reviewed the documentation from the seller of the High Halstow house and are waiting on the land registry searches - hopefully a simple process since the house is only 20 years old. Our mortgage application has been approved following three lengthy appointments with the provider, we‚Äôre now just waiting for the desk-based valuation to come through before we receive our offer. We have been to view the house again with Victoria‚Äôs Dad and spent a bit more time checking things out and looking at the garden and garage which we weren‚Äôt able to last time. All very good, can‚Äôt wait to get moved in!

Back in Upnor we‚Äôve been getting things packed up ready for the move. We had a literal pallet of packing materials delivered a few weeks ago and since then we‚Äôve been working on getting all the boxes built and filled. So far, so good. The rower which has been sitting in the garage for the last few months is now carefully packed back into it‚Äôs box ready to move too! Next job is to try and arrange for a removal company to come quote for the move, because we have far too much stuff to move ourselves in a van.

Other big news is the arrival of my MacBook Pro. Very big day! I have started a blog post to share more about it, but essentially it‚Äôs the most amazing computer I‚Äôve ever used. It cost a lot of money, but it is everything I had hoped it would be. Very pleased indeed. This is the first blog on the new machine!

Over the weekend we went out and enjoyed the fireworks at Medway Yacht Club with family. It was cold but really good fun. Especially fitting as this was one of the first things we did after we moved back to Upnor. Ready for our next milestone now.

Hurry up, bean!
