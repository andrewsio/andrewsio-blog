Janine and Tony from [Southern Scuba](http://www.southernscuba.co.uk/) offered me the opportunity to come along to [Vobster Quay](http://www.vobster.com/) last weekend. Vobster is a fresh water inland limestone quarry in Somerset, about a three hour drive from home. A perfect chance to get into the water and start diving after the Christmas.

This was my first time I had been to Vobster and I was very impressed with their setup, a good flat area for kitting up and getting ready, with most spots under cover. They had a good sized shop, hot food/drinks and an attended fill station. The kitting up area is right next to the car park too, so no need to walk a long way or carry equipment very far. One of the coolest features is their wristband 'tab' system, which allows you to buy what you need, gas, food, drink, accessories and then simply pay when you're finished.

Vobster was the first chance I have had to try my new regulators and BCD out which I bought just before Christmas, they have been sitting patiently in the cupboard at home. The Regulators I had serviced by Kent Diving a few weeks back and was keen to make sure they worked as they should. Both BCD and regulators were fantastic, very happy with them and despite being second hand look and appear brand new. It really makes a huge difference using equipment that is mine to use and tweak to my preference.

We did two dives over the Sunday and saw some interesting underwater attractions, a very large boat, tunnel, toilet(!), commercial jet plane and a car. The dives weren't too deep, most of the time we were about 12 meters down. I managed to get quite cold in a leaky dry suit, but enjoyed all of the dives and can't wait to come back and do some more exploring.

This year is going to be a busy year for diving, aiming to get my PADI Sidemount, Rescue and Nitrox certifications in order to be ready for a liveaboard trip to Egypt in September. Once I have those certifications completed I should be in a good place to either move to Master Scuba Diver or progress into Divemaster.
