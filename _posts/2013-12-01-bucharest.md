This week I got the chance to travel to Bucharest, Romania to visit our Global Service Desk. We had a an issue accessing a firewall remotely and it was causing some unexpected routing behaviour so on the advice of TAC it needed to be rebuilt. Here is me standing in front of the enormous Palace of the Parliament, this building is very impressive. Many of the locals told me that the building is even larger underground than it is above due to Ceau»ôescu's fear that there may be a revolution.
