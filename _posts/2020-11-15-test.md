The best Formula 1 season in history? It's certainly up there and there's no doubt in my mind that it has been the most memorable. It doesn't feel like very long ago that the sport was thrown into turmoil when the opening race in Melbourne was dramatically cancelled just before it was due to start. Somehow, F1 organisers managed to pull together a 17-race season that while lacked the 'flyaway' circuits instead featured classic tracks such as Imola, PortimÃ£o and the NÃ¼rburgring.

Lewis has been dominant this season, winning ten of the fourteen races so far and matching and then exceeding the most wins in history. His win here at Turkey was earned, he started sixth after a disruptive, wet Saturday session but knuckled down on a wet and slippery Saturday to take 1st place and with it, his 7th world title - a record man believed unattainable.

There's no question now that Hamilton is the greatest of all time and he's far from done yet. Which begs the question, why has he not yet been knighted?
