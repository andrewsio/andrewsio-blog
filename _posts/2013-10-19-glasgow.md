Another Cisco LAN upgrade, this time is Glasgow. Now, it turns out that there aren't that many landmarks in Glasgow so, yeah... Here is a picture of The[Finnieston Crane](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finnieston_Crane) - officially known as the Stobcross Crane it was built in 1926 and was used primarily for lifting heavy steam machinery to/from ships docked alongside. This particular picture involved a 40 minute walk in the rain, shan't be rushing back to Glasgow!
