I could totally take more weekends like this! The weather was amazing this weekend so @tigziefc and I went for a bike ride around Upnor. The first proper time we have been back since we were in our teens!

We were planning to go to Bedgebury Pinetum but since it's a long way away and it's the first time I've had my bike out this year, we thought we'd play it safe and go somewhere locally. We of course found time for a quick beer too! (which is something you can't do in Bedgebury!)
