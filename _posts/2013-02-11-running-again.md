It's been a while since I last did much running. There was that one time this year where I decided it would be a good idea to go running in a pair of shorts and a t-shirt in the freezing weather. I managed 3km in about 50mins I felt very, very ill afterwards. Not exactly my finest moment.

But now, I've once again committed to a gym membership! Hurray for the indoors! Since it's a local authority gym the membership is pretty cheap but seems to be doing the trick.

I've been taking it easy to start with, my first time on the running machine I did 5.10km in 35mins with no gradient. Not the best time, but I spent about 10mins warming up and down. My legs were ruined after this, for about a week.

The second time I put a bit more into it. I did 4Km with a gradient of 2 (which I'm presuming is actually 2%?) in 30mins with a 4min full out stint at a gradient of 8. This still includes warming up/down for 9 mins. Legs are currently a bit ruined but we'll see how they go!
