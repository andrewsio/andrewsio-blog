Today we covered lots of things! The day started discussing the lab that we were using and how it is configured. The course is provided by Fast Lane through QA and the lab itself is located in Windsor - all of the Call Manager servers, are run on an ESX host with a router and switch in the classroom running a VPN back to there. There is also a set of routers which have some voice configuration and allow us to have a branch and main office. When we were talking about the lab we made some test calls and ran a hidden command 'csim start <number>' which instructs the router to initiate a test call of  the specified number.

We moved on to a topic we'd briefly covered - Dial Plans, discussing types of call routing, how and where calling search spaces and partitions are applied. This took some understanding as there is a lot of flexibility as to how this can be configured - we discussed some best practices and why them may or may not be used in a certain environment.

Hunt groups were up next - they sound pretty boring but I was surprised just how powerful they are. Apparently with the newer call manager versions you can almost have a queuing system just using hunt groups, with call waiting etc..

Finally we went over the IP Phone registration process in a bit more detail and covered off Device pools and date/time in more detail.

The bus was a failure on the way home. i stood in the freezing rain waiting for 15mins (which is long, in London) for one. Was not impressed. I seem to have developed a rather sore throat too, which is not fun. Oh and the picture is the view from the window of the training room, cool huh?
