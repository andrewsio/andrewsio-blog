Found these while sorting through some old stuff, thought I would share. This fine piece of network engineering was a collaboration between myself and +Jack Wallis, Possibly one of our proudest achievements at a certain previous employment. For those curious whether mounting a Cisco AIR-ANT2410Y-R on a window is possible, we can confirm this works perfectly. Buy some duct tape, crack out your ingenuity and it should work a treat.

For those wondering about the setup: This was a temporary bodge for a building that was soon to be demolished, we had a few old BT lines that were taking forever to get moved. Please don't attempt this for any connectivity you actually care about. ;)
