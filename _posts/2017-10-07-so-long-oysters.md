This is a first, for me. I consider myself very lucky in that I don’t have any allergies to foods, medicines or anything else - at least, that I’m aware of. It does seem, however, that I have developed a problem with Oysters. I had hoped that recent post consumption effects were just coincidental or even very bad luck, but three identical instances gives some certainty to what I can only assume is an intolerance. It was all quite sad searching through Google Photos and seeing all the times I have shared what is was quite possibly my favourite of all delicacies. Anyway, a pointless blog but an event which I felt was markedly worthy of some internet words and of course, a photograph. So long, Oysters.
