I'm not going to beat around the bush here... I've seen better kept stations. It appears to have been attacked by seagulls! Port Issac Is a tiny town on the north coast of Cornwall between Tintagnel and Padstow, it's become famous for being the set for the ITV series Doc Martin. It's an operational fishing port with some lovely pubs and spectacular scenery.

There is only a small D-Class dinghy based at Port Issac, the boat is named Copeland Bell (ON D-707).
