While 'testing' out the new waterproof camera I seem to have ruined all the good pictures with a drop of water that remained on the lens. Whoops! Never mind, here is one of us on Thomson's shiny new 787 Dreamliner. There are many stories to be told of the plane and the trip, although unfortunately since I have _the_ worst wifi connection in the entire world so they will have to wait. Weather here is fantastic and as usual I am suffering a very red nose despite hosing it with sun cream hourly. The red nose may or may not also have something to do with there being no 'good' pictures... Right, off for another Tequila (and to try and upload this post!)
