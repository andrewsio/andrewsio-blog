My bucket list is going surprisingly well, I've been really lucky and have had the opportunity to complete almost 20% of my list in just a few years. I've blogged about every item, you can read more by following the links on the [Bucket List Page](/menu/thelist.html). I've decided to start to expand the list; my first addition is to Visit the British Overseas Territory of Saint Helena. St Helena is a very small island off the west cost of Africa in the Southern Atlantic Ocean, it is one of the most isolated islands on earth. The island has been something of a fascination to me in recent years, kicked off my my discovery that they have their [own currency](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint_Helena_pound), which i thought was fantastic! The island is currently only accessible by boat, regularly served by the RMS St Helena for both passengers and cargo, the ship is one of the last remaining vessels under the service of the Royal Mail.

What is even more interesting is that the island is currently building it's first airport. The islanders have been petitioning the UK government for funding for this essential infrastructure since 2005. The airport is expected to be operational from 2016. More information about this project can be found on the wiki page here: [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint\_Helena\_Airport](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint_Helena_Airport) and on the official St Helena Access site here: [http://www.sainthelenaaccess.com/](http://www.sainthelenaaccess.com/).

Number 32 will probably be a long way away, it's going to be a fairly 'hardcore' piece of travel even if I were to travel in via the new airport!
