This week we went to St Austell in Cornwall. We drove - Because well frankly it's cheaper (just), easier, allows us to drive around, allows us to leave when we want and it's quicker (marginally). Which is all well and good... But I don't get to go on a train! The time before last that we visited St Austell we did get the train all the way from Strood via London Paddington (I've only just realised that I haven't actually blogged about that - whoops). I enjoyed it a bit more than [@tigziefc](https://twitter.com/tigziefc), the idea that you can mooch around, walk to the bar not have to worry about stopping to go to the loo or concentrate on idiotic motorists is very appealing - but it is a long way and does get rather busy! The only disappointing part about last time is that I didn't get to go all the way to Penzance which is a good hour more away from St Austell.

This time we did get to go! We caught the 0927 St James' Park to Penzance service which arrived somewhat late into St Austell. The service was very busy, but luckily we both got seats. We were on a two carriage [Class 150 DMU](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Rail_Class_150) TOPS number 150232.

Penzance station is far smaller than I had imagined with only four platforms, three of which are covered. It is the terminus for a variety of services including Cross Country, First Great Western High Speed services, Riveria Sleeper and Devon/Cornwall regional trains.

While in Penzance we went to a great pub called The One and All - it's situated north west of the station and is just over the road. They had [Betty Stogs](http://www.skinnersbrewery.com/beers/betty_stogs) on tap which is a very nice beer.

We caught the 1644 Penzance to Plymouth service on the way back. It was equally as busy, especially after Truro! TOPS Number 150219.

I think next time we're down in Cornwall we will travel on the Riveria Sleeper, it just sounds like fun! All the way to Penzance of course... got to have that lay-in.
