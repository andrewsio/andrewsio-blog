My close friend [@geekyjames](https://twitter.com/geekyjames) and I are unequivocal fans of BrewDog, the Scottish craft beer company. Known for their iconic Punk IPA beer and brash attitude towards typical business convention they are without doubt one of the most notable new breweries globally. The company is expanding rapidly and has just opened a brand new brewery in Columbus, Ohio, looking to begin their expansion in the USA - as impressive as that expansion is, [@geekyjames](https://twitter.com/geekyjames) and I are quite content exploring their more local bars and our latest is Leeds in the North of England, a town neither of us had visited before.

I’ll start by saying Leeds took us both by surprise with its fantastic craft beer scene, there were several absolutely fantastic bars dotted across the city. Brew Dog Leeds continues this trend and occupies an absolutely perfect central location just south of Leeds Corn Exchange. The interior space of the bar follows the typical BrewDog style, exposed stained wood work, harsh metal fixtures and raw brickwork. The iconic tattoo-like painted walls are prevalent throughout with the downstairs area featuring a large dominating solid stone bar with high-table seating and a prominent black spiral stair case. Upstairs there is a beer-chiller room, the beer kegs are brought up using an electric winch, which I thought was most novel! Upstairs offers a more intimate and relaxed space, with booth style seating offering retro computer games. The room has a high ceiling with exposed rafters making the space feel very large despite its small size.

We visited at peak time on a Tuesday evening and the bar was busy but by no means full (others in the area were) which provided good ambience without being oppressive, we were easily able to hold a conversation and have good fun with the Super Nintendo!

Undoubtedly one of our favourite of BrewDog’s bars this was a complete gem and we will certainly be back to visit again. Leeds also has a unique BrewDog spot called ‘ShuffleDog’ which we didn't have time to visit but look forward to dropping by in the near future.
